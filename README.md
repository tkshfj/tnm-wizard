# TNM Wizard

We propose the design of a small intranet web application, “TNM Wizard,” which can be accessed from Windows clients via a web browser. The application converts structured input choices into standardized synoptic cancer pathology diagnostic paragraphs, in line with the Japanese General Rules for Clinical and Pathological Study of Cancer.
